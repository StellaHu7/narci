The hazard is not simply guilt because ideals have not been met. Rather, any loss of a good and coherent self-feeling is associated with intensely experienced emotions such as shame and depression, plus an anguished sense of helplessness and disorientation. To prevent this state, the narcissistic personality slides the meanings of events in order to place the self in a better light.
Such fluid shifts in meanings permit the narcissistic personality to maintain apparent logical consistency while minimising evil or weakness and exaggerating innocence or control. As part of these manoeuvres, the narcissistic personality may assume attitudes of contemptuous superiority toward others, emotional coldness, or even desperately charming approaches to idealised figures."


Freud regression:
subject-directed libido to object-directed libido process
default to next stage when reaches the object
default to regression stage:
                    first adaptive narcissism: one self gratification
                    second mal-adaptive narcissism: fail to project libido to object
lazy to take the "easy" route of resorting to one self and reinvesting libidinal resources "in-house" rather than making an effort (and risking failure) to seek out libidinal objects other than one self. 
                    fantasyland to reality, grandiose self-conception to realistic appraisal, masturbation and fantasies to mature adult sex and daydreaming to real life achievements.

Jung regression:
mental picture of the psyche as a giant warehouse of archetypes:
                    fantasies are just a way of accessing and releasing these archetypes.
regression is just one choice or embodiment of adaptation strategy, cannot secure a steady flow of gratification.


The regression is a compensatory process to get to adaptation in the sense of gratification
narcissism(first & secondary) to adaptation reacting in fuctioanl and adaptive behaviors to secure gratification
                                 *if not gratified (anxiety), the behavior are inadaptive yet, need to enhance adaptation.

Freud introversion:
pathological service to narcissism

Jung introversion:
useful tool in the service of the psychic quest for adaptation strategies (narcissism being one of them)
introversion is not pathological since no psychological mechanism is pathological
the use made of introversion can be pathological.(Jung) vs introversion is a permanent feature of a person's psyche, which facilitates pathological narcissism.(Freud)

Degree to narcissistic train:
the habitual and predominant focus of one-self, exlusion of others, leads to the degree of pathological narcissism(exlusive and all-pervasive)
when adaptive mechanism goes awry to neuroses form
                                                  :narcissism either POINT(Freud) or CONTINUUM(Jung)
                                                  
Kohut:
the pathological narcissism is the result of defective, deformed or incomplete narcissistic (self) structures.

core self-constructs: "grandiose exhibitionistic self" + "idealised parent imago"
                       parents'responses help maintain the self-structures. Without the appropriate responses, grandiosity, for instance, cannot be transformed into adult ambitions and ideals
narcissism (subject-love) and object-love coexist and interact throughout life.

self-disorders: result of the perturbed development of narcissism
                development-childhood traumas: not been seeing or being regarded as abuse objects
                           -lack of continuity & self-worth
                           -existential depressions *(other that depression: guilt-conscious depressions of neurotics)
                           -rage of depression: searching for conflict to relieve the suffering from poorly recognized-self
consideration of disordered self-object: the formative experiences in childhood of the total body-mind-self and its self-object environment
                                         the experience of joy of self-feeling being confirmed
                                         the experience of deadness...
                                         
constructs: building on SELF self-object experiences
permanent psychological patterns for viable change: archaic drives, archaic internal objects locking in deep; on-set in splitting defences

Karen Horney:
object relations in psychodynamics: personality shaped by external environment (object relations is one of...)
                                    object relations in childhood determines the functioning of one's personality
satisfaction of childhood's needs through parental door as any other drives
anxiety: the very dependence of the child on adults for survical
         conflict that the uncertainty of love, protection but needs
defences: compensate for the intolerable and gradual realisation
          giving satisfaction and a sense of security
          once the defence being perceived to be attacked (even in therapy), anxiety is reawakened
          
Karen B. Wallant: Capacity for Attachment, treating addictions and the alienated self
         few loving attachments for addict, the detached self while alone: 
                                                                           the feeling-state: monsters in, without powerful other to help
        (patients: idealising attachment transference; therapist as distrusted intruder)

NEUROTIC strategies (not adaptive strategy): submission, aggression, detachment
*learn to sacrifice a part of one's autonomy, of WHO he is, in order to feel secure.

The issue of Seperation and Individuation:
The self is a construct (social), an assimilation of the oft-imitated and idealised parents plus the internalisation of the way others perceive the child in social interactions.
                                  an internalised reflection, an imitation, a series of internalised idealisations to pathological narcissism (a matter of quantity rather than quality)

Childhood Traumas:
ages 0 to 4: irreversible and highly idiosyncratic horror
verbal and psychological-emotional abuse or neglect are of equal standing (differ with the performance of emotional outcomes)
                                                                           parents can be physically or mentally handicapped for losing control over abuse or neglect
perception of physical and sexual abuse: emotions of shame and guilt being repressed to anxiety and "neurosis"
qualitatively different to invlove child to trauma actively or passively
effect: dissociation, personality disorders
        repress emotions, resorts to violence, denies reality, escaptism, disintegrates
narcissistic strategy (narcissistic personality): fearful of further rejection and abuse, seek gratification of self-loved and self-sufficient
   
Narcissist's family:
young children towards self-esteem: feelings of being loved, accepted, valued by significant others (unconditional)
                                    build the capacity to withstand criticism and negative evaluation, accompanying socialization in larger community
older children: feelings of oneself against some external criteria

coming next to larger community:
internalise the criteria of conditioned acceptance and love to self-worth, a sense of to be attained on the criteria (observe & participate)

* relationship bewteen self-esteem & self-construct and the mother-child attachment
               with continuity in development of self-conception across many years
               working models of mother-child attachment in the mould of child's environment:
                                                                                             particular kind of person for eliciting particular behaviours
Narcissist's mother:
* narcissistic disorder from the prototypical relationship with mother
                                                                     if the mother gives child a sense of insecurity, the world tends to be dangerous, that incorporated in the Superego
primary object (OP): child identifies itself as an object.
                     has both a self and the ability to relate to objects, as observer and integrator
                     this intimacy with a familiar and predictable object (oneself) is a primary source of security 
                                                                                     & the precursor to emerging narcissism
Secondary object (SO-mother): a "good enough" SO serves to extend the lessons of the PO and apply them to the world at large.
                              right positively reinforcing experiences (external safety) to modify the primitive narcissism to a higher form of narcissism: 
                                                                                                                                                           self-love and self-esteem
adaptive strategy: regression to primary object (oneself) as substitute object if secondary object fails (wrong object)-- adaptive and survival-oriented act.
                                                                                                          wrong target for object-love, change the secondary object to oneself
                                                                                                          object-love continues: the capacity even its implementation
object-relation failure to narcisisstic perception: objects as extensions of PO or a merger with one's self

object perception: interaction bewteen the core self and others
                   true self socially (self-object) vs false self narcissistically (variations of self)
SEGO: modification of internalized PO + SO
      idealised and internalized SO
      Superego + idealised social interactions throughout life
Ideal Ego: modified PO with input by SO ("You are loved", or "You are a bad boy")

narcissist's working model: the internalisation of primary object, secondary object, auxiliary object and the outcomes of interaction (in abstract work)
                            dehumanise, devalue,idealise in the potential interactions with meaningful objects
                            can't feel empathic towards an representation or an object of gratification
